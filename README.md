# Welcome to Islamipedia

* This website is the technical side of our more polished site, which Inshallah should be released in the future after we add all the content here
* The articles are seperated into variables (e.g. for quran: surah_name, tafsir, explanation, arabic etc.)
* When will we finish?: once we have got at least 20000+ articles (hadith, quran, fiqh, studies hub, mosque etc.)

**Planned site structure**
Index > Bookshelf (e.g. Quran bookshelf, hadith bookshelf, fiqh bookshelves etc.) > Book (e.g. quran_bookshelf/tafisr/surah_fatihah or hadith_bookshelf/bukahri/1)
